Wait its FREE?!?\r\nYes, this bot api is FREE! That said I would love some donations to upgrade from a free web host to a renting a real server. With that said again, I am in no way shape or form asking for donations. The free server host I have now\r\nworks... Responses may just be a little slower. Tired of slow responses from our server and don't trust me with\r\nyour money? That cool too, the code is available for you to download and host on your own server or localhost.\r\nYou can use git to keep up-to-date or download manually.\r\n\r\n### Donations\r\nTo contribute towards this project, please use:\r\n- [Donate](https://twitch.streamlabs.com/sarimoko#/)\r\n- [GameWisp](https://gamewisp.com/sarimoko)\r\n- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sarimoko)",
